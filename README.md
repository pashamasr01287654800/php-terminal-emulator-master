# php-terminal-emulator-master
This project is a simple yet powerful PHP-based terminal emulator that mimics a command-line interface in a web browser. It provides basic functionality to execute system commands and persist them across sessions. The terminal is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access, offering a secure way to interact with the underlying server.

Features:

Password Protection: Secure login using a password to access the terminal.

Command Persistence: The ability to "persist" commands, keeping them active across sessions.

Command Execution: Execute shell commands and view their outputs.

Session Management: User sessions are maintained, with the ability to clear the session and log out.

Customizable: Easily extend or modify commands and functionality as needed.


Installation:

Clone this repository to your web server and navigate to the script in your browser to begin using the terminal emulator.


Usage:

1. Open the script in a web browser.


2. Enter the password to log in.


3. Type commands into the input field and press Enter to execute them.


4. Use the Persist button to keep specific commands active across sessions.



Commands:

Password: Log in by entering the password.

logout: Log out from the terminal session.

clear: Clear the terminal screen.

Any other command: Executes the command on the server.
